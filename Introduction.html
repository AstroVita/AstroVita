    <h2 class="glow">Introduction</h2>
      <div><h3>Naming Of The Project</h3>
        <p>The name <b>AstroVita</b> is a combination of Astro (Astronomy) which is the study of the great Universe(space) and Vita (bio) which means life. The combined word AstroVita means life in space.<br><br>

        When our team tried to find a good name for this project, my friend Shaurya said we should also use some other languages. Then we saw Vita, which means life in Latin. If we could make a good word with Vita, we could name our project after that.<br><br>
       
       Since this project was being built in space we named it AstroVita. After getting permission from our mentor, it was official.<br><br>
       
       AstroVita Symbolises Our Project’s Main aim of creating a habitat for the human race to survive happily.<br>

      <div><H3>General Presentation Of the Base</H3>
       <p><b>Overview:-</b> The Space Station AstroVita will be a continuing toroidal space settlement located at L1 {1,500,000 km (932,000 mi) from Earth}. It will be able to sustain 2000 passengers (including Farmers, Scientists, Teachers, Industry Workers, etc.)
        <br><br>The structure consists of 4 major components
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: square;">
            <li><h4>Central Hub (Cylinder)</h4></li>
              <ul>
                <li>It is the core of the settlement holding all the parts together by spokes. </li>
                <li>It also contains an elevator that will work using an EM(ElectroMagnet).</li>
                <li>It will have no gravity.</li>
                <li>On the top surface of the Central Hub, there will be a Docking Station. Whereas on the bottom surface will be the Thrusters & Boosters</li>
              </ul>
            <li><h4>Toroids Or Torii</h4></li>
              <ul>
                <li>These toroids are going to contain the main compartments of our structure (such as the residential Area, Agriculture Area, Industrial Area, Recreation Zone, etc)</li>
                <li>There will be 4 toroids (2 Large & 2 Small)</li>
             </ul>
            <li><h4>Spokes</h4></li>
             <ul>
              <li>They will be the connectors of the Toroid/Solar panels to the Central Hub.</li>
              <li>It will follow the diameter of the Toroids.              </li>
              <li>Allow Easy access to the other side of the Toroid or into the Hub.              </li>
             </ul>
            <li><h4>Solar Panels</h4></li>
             <ul>
              <li>The Solar Panels will allow us to run the AstroVita by making renewable energy from the Sun’s rays.
              </li>
             </ul>
        </ul>

            <td>Cylinders provide a structurally efficient design that can distribute stress evenly,making them resilient under rotational forces and external pressures in space. <br><br>
              
              A cylinder offers a significant amount of interior space for habitats, central control tower, especially if the cylinder is large and hollow.<br><br>
              
              Cylinders can be designed in modular sections, making them easier to assemble and expand over time.<br><br>
              
              Cylinders can be shielded with regolith or water, protecting inhabitants from harmful cosmic rays and solar radiation
            </td>
            <td>Building a large, pressurised, and rotating cylindrical habitat in Space presents significant engineering and logistical challenges.<br><br>

              Rotating the cylinder to generate artificial gravity requires energy, especially for maintaining precise rotation speeds and stabilising gyroscopic effects.<br><br>
              
              Large cylinders are susceptible to micrometeoroid impacts and require robust materials to prevent catastrophic failure in the vacuum of space.<br><br>
              
              While radiation can be mitigated, achieving sufficient shielding while keeping the cylinder light enough for construction and launch can be difficult.
